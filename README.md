To use this mod as a dependency on Mod.io
You can leave all blueprints and meshes inside the OldHorde folder, and just drag and drop into your level as needed, set the gamemode in worldsettings, and also make childs of blueprints to drag into your mod content folder.
Using as a dependency will insure that you are always running the latest version of OldHorde in your mod.


Additionally you can also drag all the non-level files into your mod, if you want it to be standalone without a dependencey. This will make it so that any updates I do to OldHorde will not be updated in your mod.
